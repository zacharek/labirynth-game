## Labyrinth Game
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Randomly generated labyrinth. Main objective is to through the maze as fast sa you can. Project is about half way completed. 
Mobiles are not supported yet. On resolutions other than FullHD character will not scale properly.
+ Animations for player's character were currently disabled due to unexpected behaviour(going to fix it soon)!
